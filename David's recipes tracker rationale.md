# David's recipes tracker

## Project Journal

## Step by step 
- [ ] Begin research through topic desired for coding
In this part of the project I wanted to be as creative as possible with something I enjoy doing in a daily basis which is cooking. I always loose track of recipes I like as I enjoy modifying and make my own recipes. I thought this would be a good opportunity for exploring integrate a digital archive of my recipes. 
- [ ] Organizing back end 
This has been one of the biggest challenges and one of the steps I invested a lot of time of. I basically was falling behind two weeks in content that I could not began coding due to issues with my computer.
- [ ] Begin installing relevant software
At first I used my regular windows computer and LAMP would not be able to run the data base even with the MySQL, and APACHE were working. 
- [ ] Check software compatibility
I swapped to Mac and LAMP did not worked as I had compatibility issues with the versions in software and I had to re-installed to check what was the error. Turned out I was able to use XAMPP for my data base which worked right away.
- [ ] Setting up Github
Once all the components worked I setted up the repostory in Github, which was already well understood in the "how to's" from front web desing last semester 
- [ ] Organising database folders
I organised relevant folders to store information so I could have the access in to my coding software brakets 
All components of the folders were easy to set up. However, the one I had issues with finding out how to fix it was update-work.php which did not allowed me to update the recipes stored in the data base. Everytime I tried to re-arrange or change the code all the elements were not working so I decided to leave it so I was not breaking more parts of the functional code.
- [ ] Organizing front end 
This was an enjoyable part of the project as it focused in the aesthetics and the simple approach of a recipe tracker. I implemented an easy look and a friendly looking intuitive look.
- [ ] Coding CSS
The CSS was my own imagination of how I wanted the site to be interactive,as often to much details for food websites may be intrusive for the user in to why people goes in to the site. 
This is a recipe tracker only, not a food book where you can find photos of recipes and or experiences of people cooking based on their travel experience. 

- [ ] Coding CSS
I tried to have the page as simple as possible, to have it more intuitive rather than intrussive for the user. The site may not have a lot of interaction planned but is functional and easy to understand in the layout as well as the colours of the background, letters and typography (this was the only fun part).

## Web hosting 

- [ ] Setting up Siteground
Setting up the site was not as easy as it seemed as there were a few steps not so intuitive.
Initially I assumed that the database and the user name were linked together. However, they were not and as accesing the page I was having errors mentioning that the user name had no access to the data base. 
Once I figured that I had to linked the user name and the data base together there were no more issues. 

- [ ] Brief conclusion 
This project helped me out to understand back end and front end programs. Although it was not enjoyable, tricky to set up and time consuming experience I take the best out of it which is understanding of how websites come to be delivered by the users.
